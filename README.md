# Algorithms and Data Structures
Collection of repositories containing various Algorithms and Data Structures learned during the course of the same name at my University. Part of the code in those repositories was written by me as an assignment and the other part was already given and written by my Professor. 

## Technologies
* Java
* JUnit
* JaCoCo

## Other Algorithms
During the course I learned many other algorithms that were not implemented. A few examples:
* LZ77, LZSS, LZ78, LZW, LZC
* Move to Front
* Burrows-Wheeler Transform
* Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms
* Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
* Rabin-Karp Algorithm
* Knuth-Morris-Prat Algorithm
* Booyer-Moore Algorithm
* Finite State Machine for Pattern Searching
* Genetic Algorithm

## Setup and usage
Should one want to use those algorithms they ought to simply copy the desired code to the project. To run one of the repositories one should open them using maven project. The IDE that was used is NetBeans but it should work just fine in any other.
